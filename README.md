## SymC in Cosmology: Critical-Damping Dynamics Across Quantum Measurement, Field Stability, and Cosmic Acceleration

This repository contains the SymC cosmology research program, where the universal critical-damping boundary (χ = γ/2|ω|) is applied to the largest dynamical system accessible to physics: the evolution of the universe itself. These works extend the SymC framework into quantum measurement, early-universe field relaxation, horizon-layer physics, oscillatory substrate modes, and the emergence of late-time cosmic acceleration.

The central idea is that the same χ-governed stability window that appears in quantum systems, biological regulation, seismology, and neural dynamics also governs cosmological evolution. In the SymC model, cosmic acceleration is not a parameter to be inserted — it is a stability phase of the cosmic substrate itself, inherited through cross-domain χ transitions and second-order exceptional point behavior.

### Included Papers
- **Cosmic Acceleration (v4):** Critical-damping evolution linking quantum measurement to large-scale cosmic dynamics.  
- **SymC in Black-Hole Structure:** EP-boundary behavior and critically damped horizons.  
- **SymC Coupled-Oscillator Neutrinos:** Flavor oscillation as χ-driven substrate dynamics.  
- **SymC and the QFT:** Dissipative field dynamics and exceptional-point convergence.

### Key Contributions
- A universal χ-boundary applied to cosmology and horizon physics  
- A substrate-inheritance model explaining transitions from the quantum regime to classical expansion  
- A natural stability-derived origin for cosmic acceleration  
- A cross-domain unification linking microscopic oscillatory systems to macroscopic expansion behavior  

### Purpose of the Repository
This space provides a clear, structured home for SymC cosmological work, enabling researchers to trace how the universal damping boundary shapes:
- quantum-to-classical transitions  
- early universe relaxation  
- neutrino oscillation stability  
- black-hole horizon structure  
- late-time acceleration  

All papers are fully open-access (Zenodo), rigorously cross-referenced, and formatted for reproducible theoretical development.
